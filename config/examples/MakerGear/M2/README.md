Many variations of the MakerGear M2 have shipped.

The configuration was derived from the following firmware available from MakerGear:M2Marlin-01-14-2016-OriginalZMotor.zip

When using the [MakerGear firmware selector](http://firmware.makergear.com/#1), this printer used to configure this firmware correspondes to the following options:

- Silver Z Motor
- 24V Power Supply
- Zmin (top) endstop
- V4 hotend
- No LCD

If your M2 has different options than this, configuration changes may be needed to work properly.
